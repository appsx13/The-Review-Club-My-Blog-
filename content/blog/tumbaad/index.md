---

Tumbbad, one of the best Bollywood movie I ever watch, this movie revolves around one thing- GREED. This movie teaches us to be satisified with what we have.

Every character of the movie can be divided in two parts greedy and non greedy. Movie has a mythological god called Haster who is believed to be first and most- beloved child of Goddess of Prosperity

One family decided to go against the gods and worshipped the demon-god haster, for wealth. Vinayak is one of the generation of that family. Their all generation fall into the trap of Greed.

In the end Vinayak dies to save his son from Haster.
