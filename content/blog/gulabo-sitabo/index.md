We often read the quote Greed is a permanent salevery that is best described by "Gulabo and Sitabo"

Well written characters, colourful dialogues and masterful cinematography make Gulabo Sitabo a pleasant watch.

The movie start with the entry of bachchan sir who is playing a character of greedy old man (Mirza) and Ayushmaan khurana who is playing a role of Baankey.

The main focus of Mirza’s (Amitabh Bachchan) hostility is Baankey(Ayushmaan Khurana), who lives with his mother and sisters in a few crowded rooms, and pays the rent of 30 rupees . When their battle escalates — who will pay to fix the bathroom wall? — a small-time lawyer becomes involved. And a government archaeologist also snooping around, who has his own plans for Fatima Mahal.

However the main hero of this movie is Fatima mahal.
Set in old Lucknow, with the modern world intruding at first only in a few objects (a motorcycle, a cellphone), “Gulabo Sitabo” is at once a lightly allegorical riff on the forces and counterforce of Indian modernization and a character-based comedy powered by two Bollywood stars.
